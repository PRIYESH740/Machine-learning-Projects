# Machine Learning Projects  
### 1.House price prediction using Linear Regression  
The House Price Prediction project on boston dataset uses Linear Regression to estimate the price of a house based on key features like TAX,pupil-teacher ratio by town, 
Age, capita crime rate by town, radial highway ,proportion of non-retail business acres per town and other relevant factors.  

### 2.Predicting the boltimore salary using Support vector Regressor  
The Baltimore Salary Prediction project utilizes a Support Vector Regressor (SVR) to estimate salaries based on features such as JobTitle, HireDate, department, and other relevant factors.
This project showcases the power of Support Vector Regressor in modeling complex, non-linear salary trends based on diverse features.  

### 3.Car Price Prediction using Decision Tree Regressor and Random forest regressor  
The Car Price Prediction project uses a Decision Tree Regressor and Random forest regressor to estimate car prices based on features such as brand, model, year of manufacture, mile age, fuel type, engine capacity.
This project demonstrates how Decision Trees can effectively handle complex relationships and provide insights into factors affecting car prices.  

### 4.Titanic Survival dataset using Logistic Regression  
The Titanic Survival Prediction project uses Logistic Regression to classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, family size,Fare and PassengerId.
This project demonstrates the application of Logistic Regression in binary classification problems and explores the factors influencing survival on the Titanic.  

### 5.Movie rating recommendation using K Nearest Neighbour  
The Movie Rating Recommendation project utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict user ratings for movies based on features such as budget,genres,original language,overview, popularity, production companies, release date, revenue, runtime, status ,tagline, vote average, vote count.
This project showcases how KNN can be applied in collaborative or content-based filtering for personalized movie recommendations.  

### 6.Creditcard fraud detection using Decision tree Classifier And Random Forest Classifier  
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project uses Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier to detect fraudulent transactions based on features such as transaction amount, location, time, and behavioral patterns.
This project highlights the power of tree-based models in identifying fraudulent activities with high accuracy and reliability.  

### 7.Customer Segmentation using K-Mean Clustering  
The Customer Segmentation project uses K-Means Clustering to group customers based on their behaviors, gender, age,annual income, spending score.
This project demonstrates how unsupervised learning can uncover hidden patterns in customer data to drive strategic business decisions.  

### 8.Market basket analysis using Apriori algorithm and Eclat algorithm  
The Market Basket Analysis project applies the Apriori Algorithm and Eclat Algorithmto detect patterns based on features such as Member number, Date,itemDescription and to identify frequent itemsets and generate association rules, uncovering relationships between items commonly purchased together.
This project demonstrates the use of association rule mining for uncovering patterns in customer purchasing habits, enabling better decision-making in retail.
